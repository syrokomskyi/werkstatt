# Q&A Log (L0)

Append-only log of questions asked and answers given during grilling sessions. Used for meta-analysis to distill recurring decision patterns.

<!-- Entries are appended by the skill during each run. -->
<!-- Format:
## <date> — <context>
- **Question:** <short question summary>
- **Answer:** <operator's decision>
-->

## 2026-08-03 — forge knowledge lifecycle RFC series (RFC-1..5)

- **Question:** Entry format for L0/L1/L2 knowledge records?
- **Answer:** Markdown files with per-entry YAML metadata blocks (human-readable, grep-able, parseable); soft migration for existing freeform entries.
- **Question:** How to define and enforce layer token budgets?
- **Answer:** Hard defaults in forge (L2 hot ~4KB, L1 warm ~8KB, L0 cold unbudgeted), optional override in forge.yaml bindings; warning on exceed, not error.
- **Question:** Where does AI distillation L0→L1/L2 live?
- **Answer:** New skill fo-knowledge-distill alongside deterministic forge.skill.knowledge.compact command; code mutates metadata, agent distills meaning.
- **Question:** Should .agents/memory/ be versioned in git?
- **Answer:** Hybrid — MEMORY.md (curated) versioned, daily logs git-ignored.
