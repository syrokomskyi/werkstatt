# RFC-0621: Auto-commit after each operator request via forge skill

## Context

<!-- Why does this RFC exist?
     Describe the observable gap, drift, or risk in the current system.
     Reference Architecture DNA invariants, anti-patterns, or spec documents
     that this RFC is meant to close or protect. -->

## Problem

<!-- What specific invariant is unprotected right now?
     What relies on manual discipline instead of automated or documented enforcement?
     Be concrete: reference file paths, DNA invariant IDs, or known failure modes. -->

## Decision

<!-- State the single decision being made.
     One of:
     - Introduce a new OS command or set of commands
     - Add or change an architectural contract (page, component, semantic, brand, quality)
     - Establish a new governance policy
     - Deprecate or supersede an existing rule or command

     Write it in present tense as if already decided:
     "The kernel gains a `structure.validate` command that checks..."
     not "We should add..." -->

## Architectural fit

<!-- How does this decision relate to existing building blocks?
     Explain alignment with the following — skip any that are not relevant:
     - Architecture DNA (which invariants does this enforce or protect?)
     - Anti-Patterns (which patterns does this prevent?)
     - Page Contracts (which page-level rules are formalized?)
     - Component Contracts (which component-level rules are formalized?)
     - Site OS operator model (command scope, module placement, pipeline integration)
     - Scaling Playbook (does this apply uniformly across growth stages 1–4?) -->

## Design

### CLI surface

<!-- Show the exact command(s) as a user would type them:

```sh
pnpm exec site-kernel run domain.command --app main
pnpm exec site-kernel run domain.command --all --json
```

Describe flags, arguments, and scope (app | workspace).
-->

### TypeScript contracts

<!-- Specify the key types and interfaces needed.
     Do not write full implementation — write the minimum contract
     that a developer or agent needs to understand the shape.

```ts
interface ExampleInput {
  // ...
}

interface ExampleResult {
  // ...
}
```
-->

### File system responsibilities

<!-- Which files/directories does this touch or read?
     Which files does this create, validate, or refuse to touch?

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/pages/[lang]/**/*.astro` | Scanned for violations |
| `docs/rfcs/index.json` | Updated by rfc.index.generate |
-->

### Output format

<!-- Describe the --json output shape so agents can parse it reliably.

```json
{
  "command": "domain.command",
  "status": "fail",
  "violations": [
    { "file": "src/pages/de/legal.astro", "rule": "missing-schema", "message": "..." }
  ]
}
```
-->

### Failure modes

<!-- What does the command do when it finds violations?
     Does it exit non-zero? Does it log warnings only?
     What is the behavior difference between --json and pretty output?
     Are there any rules where the command should warn rather than fail? -->

## Rollout

<!-- Describe the adoption path — not a short-term wave, but a durable rollout strategy:

- Default behavior on first introduction (fail-hard vs. warn vs. opt-in)
- How existing apps adopt without a flag day (e.g., --strict mode, grace period)
- How new apps automatically comply from day one
- Deprecation path if this supersedes an existing command
- How this integrates into the `build.check` or other standard pipelines
-->

## Alternatives considered

<!-- What else was considered and why was it rejected?
     Be brief but honest — this section prevents re-litigating old decisions. -->

## Risks

<!-- Technical, organizational, or agent-facing risks.
     Include: performance impact, false positive rate, maintenance burden,
     risk of agents misinterpreting this RFC. -->

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] TypeScript types and interfaces defined in the relevant package
- [ ] CLI command registered with correct name and scope
- [ ] `--json` output format documented and stable
- [ ] Integrated into appropriate pipeline (`build.check` or standalone)
- [ ] Existing apps pass without changes (or migration path is documented)
- [ ] `AGENTS.md` updated where agent behavior rules changed
- [ ] Relevant Architecture DNA or spec docs link to this RFC
- [ ] `rfc.validate` passes on this file before merging

## Implementation notes for agents

<!-- Rules that govern how AI agents interact with this RFC.
     Be explicit. Agents read this section for behavioral policy.

- Agents MAY implement code changes ONLY when this RFC has status: accepted (or implemented).
- Agents MAY transition this RFC from `accepted` to `implemented` per RFC-0224 preconditions; reference this RFC ID in commits.
- For RFCs created on or after 2026-07-07 with acceptance probes: before stamping `implemented`, run
  `site-kernel run rfc.verification.emit --id <this-rfc-id>` and commit the evidence file
  in the same commit (RFC-0330 amended transition precondition).
- Agents MUST NOT weaken or remove enforcement rules established by this RFC
  without a new RFC that supersedes it.
- If implementation reveals an invariant conflict, run
  `site-kernel run rfc.supersede.propose --id <this-rfc-id> --reason "..." --invariant "DNA-N"`
  instead of working around it (RFC-0334).
